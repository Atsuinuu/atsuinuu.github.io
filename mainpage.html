                        There’s only one reason why I like winter.<br>
                        The leaves that were covering my window have fallen, so I can now see your window across the street.<br>
                        ​And because of Christmas and New Year’s Day, you come back to this town and spend a few days here.<br>

                        <h3>[Episode 2]</h3>
                        Irene borrowed “Wind Blowing Through a Willow Tree”<br>
                        I hope she enjoys the book, but if not, so be it.<br>
                        <br>
                        My favorite version of that book has Patrick Benson’s illustration.<br>
                        But I shouldn’t say this out loud around the book, since books and drawings have ears too.<br>
                        ​<br>
                        The night is getting deep, and I’ve talked too much. Since the nighttime is a great time to talk.<br>

                        She’s asleep right now, under the same roof as me.<br>
                        She came into my room earlier and said the old lamp on my desk was beautiful. <br>
                        I suddenly felt a surge of happiness and wanted to get on my knees and hold her hands and tell her how I felt about her, but I didn’t want to surprise her, so I just said, “Thanks.”<br> 
                        ​<br>

                        <h3>[Episode 4]</h3>
                        At today’s book club gathering, we chose our favorite quotes from poems and novels that fit with winter and shared them.<br>
                        She’s adapting quite well to this book club.<br>
                        She sometimes reads the books that our members have already read. <br>
                        <br>​                        
                        I began to wonder whether she gets curious about the person who read that book.<br>
                        Then what type of book should I choose?<br>

                        <h3>[Episode 5]</h3>
                        I thought about what I said to Irene before. <br>
                        <br>
                        All first loves are past perfect? <br>
                        Why did I say something like that?<br>
                        <br>
                        Thanks to the repair work at Hodu House, she and I are sharing the same space.<br>
                        <br>
                        If she asks me again, I can tell her that most first loves are past perfect, but I’m an exception. That I haven’t completed anything yet.<br>
                        <br>
                        P.S. Irene brought home camellia flowers.<br>
                        I asked why, and she said they were her later dad’s favorite flowers.<br>
                        <br>
                        She tells me about her family from time to time and it feels like I’m getting closer to her.<br>

                        <h3>[Episode 6]</h3>
                        Tonight, I want to read a book written by a unknown author.<br>
                        Those precious stories that make us feel sorry since we can’t pay royalties to an unknown author. <br>
                        Stories written by unknown authors will continue to be published in the future. <br>
                        <br>
                        As long as we keep forgetting and the sense of losing something continues to exist. <br>
                        Gosh, it been a hectic day.<br>
                        Like walking on clouds all day. <br>
                        I want to say something, but I need to do some  more thinking. <br>

                        Irene told me, “I like you” <br>
                        I froze in that spot and couldn’t say anything.<br>
                        Is this what you call a time that feels like an eternity?<br>
                        With those words from her mouth, the whole universe, including me, came to a stop. <br>
                        I barely pulled myself together, but all could say was “Okay.” <br>
                        What on earth have I done? It’s such a bitter night.<br>

                        There are things you can see more clearly when you’re alone, and it’s not so bad to learn from loneliness.<br>
                        The less you expect, the calmer your days are.<br>
                        It’s painful to genuinely want something. <br>
                        But I’m not without desires. <br>
                        I kissed Irene in the mountains. I almost fainted. <br>
                        I can’t joke about it anymore, which means it’s serious. <br>
                        She now lives behind my eyes.<br>

                        <h3>[Episode 9]</h3>
                        If I think about it, the Mugunghwa train was where it all started. <br>
                        It was an early autumn morning, and there were maple trees. <br>
                        She was standing there. Where the morning train had come to a stop.<br> 
                        How could I not fall in love?<br>
                        <br>
                        Actually, my history with Irene goes way back, when I was about ten, I bumped into her once. <br>
                        I thought Irene was a boy back then.<br>
                        That’s right. We might’ve been together in many more pages than we thought.<br>

                        <h3>[Episode 10]</h3>
                        Good Night Bookstore held its very first public event.<br>
                        <br>
                        Irene was more or less our leader.<br>
                        <br>
                        I’m grateful to the book club members for their hard work.<br>
                        <br>
                        In the pictures that captured their memories, they all look so happy that I almost feel jealous. <br>
                        <br>
                        Irene has become a lot more cheerful since she came here at the end of last year.<br> 
                        <br>
                        Maybe it’s just me, but she seems to laugh more often, and her darkness has faded.<br> 
                        <br>
                        Every time she smiles, it’s a dazzling sight.<br>

                        <h3>[Episode 11]</h3>
                        I was the son of a vagrant who lived in a mountain and one day, I was abandoned.<br>
                        And I was raised by adoptive parents. <br>
                        Although I don’t think of that as weakness, some people expect me to be hurt by it. <br>
                        <br>
                        Why aren’t you miserable?<br>
                        Weren’t you the boy who lived in a cottage in the mountains? <br>
                        Wasn’t your father a vagrant?<br>
                        <br>
                        Do I have to live a miserable and sad life as they want me to be?<br>
                        I though about it long and hard, and the answer was no. <br>
                        I realized there’s no reason to be miserable when I feel grateful to so many people.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anyway, it’s all in the past now.<br>

                        This is my first love letter to you.<br>
                        <br>
                        That day, through the window, I saw you looking as hurt as I was. <br>
                        I want to leave. But no. I shouldn’t. I’d feel too sorry. <br>
                        Forgetting all of that, I ended up following you. <br>
                        <br>
                        Cheongdo is famous for it persimmon trees.<br>
                        The Nakdong River that runs across the city looked clear. <br>
                        I was scared you’d jump into the river. <br>
                        Even after calling your aunt, I was still scared that you’d die. <br>
                        And that was probably our very first autumn trip together.<br>

                        Irene saw my private diary. Darn it. <br>
                        I think she saw the bookstore diary category.<br>
                        I’m not sure how much of it she read.<br>
                        Since she teased me about the marshmallow story.<br> 
                        I think she read until the part she arrived in Bukhyeon-ri.<br> 
                        How much did she read after that?<br>
                        It’s not like anything going to happen even if she read it all.<br>
                        But I almost lost my mind from sheer embarrassment.<br>

                        There was a time when I thought life was the process of finding one’s life. <br>
                        A place where it’s okay for me to exist without bothering anyone, or being bothered either. <br>
                        Finding a place where no one would refuse me.  <br>
                        That’s what I thought life was.  <br>
                        But now, I’ve changed my mind. <br>
                        Wherever it may be, the place where I am right now is my place. <br>
                        As long as I live as my true self, I believe it will be okay for me to exist in this place. <br>
                        That’s all I have to say today. If I say more, I might want to quit everything. <br>

                        Though the days piled up, I wasn’t gifted with anything different in particular. <br>
                        But when she came to me this winter and we shared love, those days didn’t pile up evenly like before.<br> 
                        The weight of today is different than before. <br>
                        Next winter will probably be even more different.<br>
                        The weight of the upcoming winter that I cannot fathom yet. <br>
                        I put up a sign that the bookstore will be closed for a few days. It feels like a bowstring that’s been tightly pulled back. <br>
                        I’ve decided to let things go and rest for a while.

                        <h3>[Episode 16]</h3>
                        I met Irene again after a long time.<br>
                        I waited and longed to see her again so much.<br>
                        But I tried to hide my feelings and stupidly turned away from her.<br> 
                        When she ran towards me and came into my arms, she melted my frozen heart yet again. <br>
                        I spent days and nights blankly without being able to sleep.<br>
                        But I can’t believe I’m back in the past now.<br>
                        It’s late at night, and she has fallen asleep on my arm. <br>
                        She is light, and smells like the grads from a spring breeze.<br>
                        Guys, the scent of acacia is filling up this place again. Roger. <br>
                        PS: She woke up from her sleep and kissed me on my nose...and fell asleep again with her head buried in my chest. I didn’t know kissing was such a nice thing.<br>
